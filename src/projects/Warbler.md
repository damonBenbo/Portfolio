### Problem Solved

While there was no problem really solved with this, I had fun working with building a twitter knock off. It helped me get more comfortable using Python as a front end tool.

### Technologies Used

The bulk of this app was made using Python and Python libraries. Flask was utilized to make the front end of the application and Jinja to create my templates to create a consistent disign throughout the website. 

For the backend, SQLAlchemy was used for facilitating changes in the database. There is full CRUD built-in to this app as users can create/view/edit/delete posts as well as profile information for their account.

### Challenges Faced

The biggest with this exercise was just familiarizing myself with Flask a bit more and getting comfortable with it.

### Lessons Learned

Sometimes it's not always the most radical design choices that create an appealing looking website, there is beauty in simplicity.
